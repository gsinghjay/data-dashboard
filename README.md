Visualization Guide:
- Blue bars: FDA Direct Approvals (1990-1997)
- Orange bars: GRAS Notices (1998-2019)
- Red line: Obesity Rate Trend
- Important Note: Data source transition in 2011 from WHO to CDC data affects trend comparability

Key Observations:
1. Regulatory Evolution (1990-2023):
   - FDA Direct Approvals (1990-1997): Peak of 206 approvals in 1990, declining to final approvals in 1997
   - GRAS Notice System (1998-2019): Started with 85 notices/year, gradually decreased to 70 notices/year
   - Post-2019: Gap in regulatory oversight with no active system

2. Obesity Rate Progression:
   - WHO Data (1990-2010): Increase from 25.5% to approximately 33%
   - CDC Data (2011-2023): Rise from 27.74% to 37.36%
   - Total increase of 11.86 percentage points over 33 years

3. Regulatory Activity Patterns:
   - FDA period: 3,971 total substances approved
   - GRAS period: 1,219 total notices processed
   - Validation rates improved over time (82.5% CAS numbers, 92.5% closure dates)

4. Safety Response Evolution:
   - 74.7% of GRAS notices received "No Questions" (911 notices)
   - 16.4% ceased evaluation (200 notices)
   - 7.5% remained pending (92 notices)
   - 1.3% had other outcomes (16 notices)

5. Data Quality Considerations:
   - Pre-2011: WHO global data provides baseline trends
   - 2011-2023: CDC US-specific data offers more accurate national picture
   - High validation rates for modern regulatory submissions
   - Geographic coverage includes all 50 states plus territories

Note: The transition between WHO and CDC data sources in 2011 may affect trend comparability.

### Command Explanations

1. **Initial Data Exploration**
   - Check CSV headers to understand data structure
   - View sample rows to understand data format
   - List column indices for accurate data extraction

2. **FDA Substance Statistics**
   - Total substances: Counts total lines in CSV minus header
   - Technical effects: Counts occurrences of each effect type
   - CAS validation: Checks for non-empty CAS numbers
   - Year range: Extracts and sorts approval years

3. **GRAS Notices Analysis**
   - Total notices: Counts total lines in CSV minus header
   - FDA responses: Categorizes and counts response types
   - Date validation: Checks completeness of filing and closure dates
   - Year range: Multiple attempts, final version uses pandas for proper CSV parsing

4. **Obesity Rate Analysis**
   - CDC trends: Calculates average obesity rates for 2011 and 2023
   - Record counts: Counts total records in both datasets
   - WHO year range: Multiple attempts, final version uses correct DIM_TIME column
   - CDC year range: Extracts years from first column

### Debugging Notes
1. **CSV Parsing Challenges**
   - Initial attempts using basic Unix tools had issues with quoted fields
   - Switched to Python/pandas for GRAS notices due to complex CSV format
   - Required multiple attempts to find correct column indices

2. **Year Range Verification**
   - WHO data required finding correct column (DIM_TIME instead of year)
   - GRAS notices needed special handling for floating-point year values
   - FDA substances required handling of .0 suffix in year values
